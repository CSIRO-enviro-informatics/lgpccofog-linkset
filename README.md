# LGPC / COFOG Linkset
This code repository contains a Linkset - a specialised Dataset linking objects in two other Datasets.

This Linkset contains [SKOS mapping properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) between Concepts in the [AGIFT](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/lgpc) and Concepts in the [COFOG](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/cofog) vocabularies.

LGPC, "Local Government Purpose Classification" is an [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au) a vocabulary of classifiers for use in the collection, analysis and dissemination of local government finance statistics in Australia.

COFOG, "Classification of the Functions of Government", is a [United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/iiss/Classification-of-the-Functions-of-Government-COFOG.ashx)-issued vocabulary used to "...distinguish between the individual and collective services provided by general government and identifies consumption expenditures that benefit individual households...".


## Linkset relations
This Linkset uses only [SKOS Mapping Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) to map between AGIFT & COFOG-A. Only the following properties are used:

* `skos:exactMatch`



## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files and folders:

* [README.md](README.md) - this file
* [imports/](imports/) - background information: the LGPC & COFOG vocabularies as RDF (turtle) files
* [data.ttl](data.ttl) - this Linkset's links as an RDF (turtle) file
* [header.ttl](header.ttl) - this Linksetâ€™s data.ttl header information, stored separately for ease of access
* [example-data.ttl](example-data.ttl) - 5 Statements from the Linkset for ease of access, in RDF (turtle) format, as per the main data file but none of the whole-of-Linkset information
* [example-data-unreified.ttl](example-data-unreified.ttl) - 5 Statements from the Linkset but flattened, 'unreified', for even easier use
* [methods/](methods/) - a folder containing the interim correspondences.xlsx file used for correspondence transpcription from the LGPC PDF document
